# API INTO AWS S3
This is an example of how to retrieve data from an API (spotify) and save it directly into Amazon S3 bucket without saving it locally.

We create a connection with spotify API to retrieve some data and automatically save it on S3 withou saving it locally. All you need to change on this code is the secret keys for spotify API and AWS S3 bucket. You can easily find how to get that secret information in the web (google, chatGPT). To use the project you need a spotify and AWS account.
